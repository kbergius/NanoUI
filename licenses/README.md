**NanoUI** is MIT licensed.

**NanoUI** consists modified ports from the [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) library (**zlib** license).

Additionally **NanoUI's** UI layer is more or less inspired by [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui) (**BSD style** license).

Also **NanoUI** consists a port of the [StbTrueType](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (**Public Domain** license).

All these licenses are permissive, free, open-source and commercial-friendly software licenses.

---

So when you ship your application/game, you should add - to be sure - **NanoUI**, **NanoGUI** and **NanoVG** licenses to your application/game.

PS I am not a lawyer, so this is not a legal advice.
