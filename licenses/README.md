**NanoUI** is MIT licenced.

However **NanoUI** consists modified ports from the [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) library (**zlib** license).

**NanoUI** also consists a port of the [StbTrueType](https://github.com/nothings/stb), but it's license is **Public Domain**.

So when you ship your application, you should add both **NanoUI** and **NanoVG** licenses to your application.

PS I am not a laywer, so this is not a legal advice.
